Welcome to the Copernicus OCDB Database System (OCDB)!
======================================================
Comparison between simultaneous in-situ measurements and satellite sensor products are fundamental for satellite product validation, to prove the accuracy and limitations of the data services.
In addition, in-situ measurements alone or combined with satellite products are required for Ocean Colour algorithm development.
Considering the need for sustained access to in situ-Fiducial Reference Measurements for the Copernicus programme, the aim of the Copernicus Ocean Colour Database (OCDB_) is to provide a platform to collect, organize and make available to the ocean colour community, ocean colour related in-situ measurements, and to ensure long-term stewardship of these critical data.

This tool enables researchers to store and share, if elected, their in-situ data in an organised Database in a standardized format.

Only when elected by the contributor, in-situ measurements are published into the Database and made available to the public. 
Quality checks on format, measurements as well as on protocol compliance are performed, and a quality flag is provided for each measurement. 
 
Published, best quality data are used to generate Match-up files with Sentinel-3 Level 2 Ocean Colour OLCI A and B products which are also made available through the Database.

The Database has been designed in order to guarantee easy access to data, a strong search engine, automation via command line access and interoperability with other Databases (in particular NASA SeaBASS Database).
