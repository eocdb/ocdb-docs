Welcome to the Copernicus OCDB Database System (OCDB)!
================================

The aim of the __Copernicus Ocean Colour Database (OCDB)__ is to provide a platform to collect, organize and make available to ocean colour community, ocean colour related _in-situ_ measurements, useful for satellite derived ocean colour products validation and algorithm development. 
This tool enables researchers to store and eventually share into an organised Database their own _in-situ_ data, in a standardized format.
