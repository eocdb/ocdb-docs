# Copernicus OCDB Data Policy 

This Copernicus OCDB provides stewardship and welcomes submissions of fiducial-reference in situ data from various providers (hereafter the Principle Investigators (PIs)).

__The following conditions must be observed when using the Copernicus OCDB data:__
- When using the Copernicus OCDB data, you are required to contact the PI about your data usage.
- When publishing or presenting the data, you must acknowledge the PI(s) for the provision of data as well as Copernicus and EUMETSAT for establishing and maintaining the OCDB. For example, the acknowledgment may read: “We thank [name of PI(s) ] for their effort in collecting the data used in this investigation and for making them available for publication. We also thank the EC Copernicus Programme and EUMETSAT for establishing and maintaining the OCDB”. 
- When publishing, you must offer a co-authorship to the PI(s) if their in-situ data is central to your publication. For publications drawing on numerous sources of in-situ data, the co-authorship may be considered for one or many of the PI(s), to be determined based on the significance of the respective in-situ data to the overall results of the publication. 


__The following must be acknowledged when submitting data to the Copernicus OCDB:__
-	By agreeing to the publication of the submitted in-situ data, you accept the general public being able to access your data. 
-	If you do not agree to the publication of your data then the data will be only visible to you and the OCDB administrators.


__In the context of the Matchup Database files__, the links below allow direct access to the most pertinent data policies outside of this OCDB, where available, or to the data source homepage. Depending on the MDB files used, the applicable data policies must be followed:

Effort is undertaken to ensure good quality of the Copernicus OC-DB data records. Nevertheless, neither EUMETSAT nor any other entity involved in the creation of the OCDB can guarantee the accuracy and completeness of the published data or their suitability for any specific purposes and, thus, shall not be held liable for any damage derived from the use.
